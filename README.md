Overview

Problem Statement
This project focuses on the classification of urban sounds into several categories, which is a crucial task for various applications such as urban planning, security, and environmental monitoring. Accurately classifying urban sounds using machine learning techniques can help in understanding and managing urban environments more effectively.

Model Description
The model employed in this project is a neural network designed to process and classify audio data. Here's what the model does:

Feature Extraction: The model starts by extracting meaningful features from audio files. For this project, we use Mel spectrogram features, which are powerful representations for audio analysis.

Classification: After feature extraction, the neural network processes these features through multiple dense layers. The layers are structured to gradually reduce in size, focusing on critical patterns and relationships in the data. Each layer uses the ReLU activation function for non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.

Output: The final layer of the model uses a softmax activation function, which provides a probability distribution across the ten possible sound classes. This output helps in determining the most likely sound category for each audio sample.

Dataset
The UrbanSound8K dataset, available on Kaggle, is used for training and testing the model. This dataset consists of 8,732 labeled sound excerpts of urban sounds from 10 classes, including car horns, children playing, dogs barking, and more. These sounds are pre-arranged into ten folds, which are used for systematically validating the model through cross-validation.

Usage
The model can classify sounds into one of the ten categories, making it valuable for applications needing sound analysis in urban settings. By providing insights into the urban soundscape, this model helps in making data-driven decisions for urban planning and noise management.
